## Graph
It has vertices and edges.

## Directed graph
Traverse in one direction

## Non-directed graph
Traverse in both direction

## Cyclic Graph
The graph which has at least one cycle

## Acyclic graph
The graph which don't have any cycle

## Tree
Directed, connected, and acyclic graph

## K-ary tree
K-child nodes

## Binary tree
2 child nodes

## Perfect binary tree
all interior nodes has 2 child. All leaf nodes has same depth

## Complete binary tree
all interior nodes has 2 child. Leaf in the last level are not at same depth.
The leaf in the last level must be as far as possible.

## Full binary tree
Each node must have 0 or 2 child nodes.

## Balance binary tree
Each node have left and right subtree, whose length must differ by 1 or 0.
